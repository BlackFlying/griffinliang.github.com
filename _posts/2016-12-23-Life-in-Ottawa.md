#### My experience in English Studying Group ####

March 22, 2017

I talked with Danielle today. And thank her for giving us a cup of mapple syrup. It tastes goood. During our conversation, we talked about the animals, such as bear, moose, salmon and so on. She is full of energy. Since we know each other before, we did not talk about a lot of our basic information. She asked me whether young people know the history of China. Maybe it's time to read some books about that for all of us.

I am very happy to have a conversation with Tom who is the husband of Jackie. I finally got her name. Tom got his Ph.D. degree from the University of Pennsylvania. His major is social system science. During his study, he spent a year and a half for the courses. Then he went back to Canada for working (which is very helpful for his Ph.D. studying). He even made his thesis published as a book. After that, he opened up his own consultant. We talked about the cook, movies (La-La-Land), sports and trip. And I think he is a very genius man. We focused on the methodology of thinking and learning. (60% knowledge from work, 10% knowledge from communication with the others, and 20% knowledge from school.) One thing he told me is people speaking more than their writing and people knowing more than their speaking. That means communicating with people is more efficient than reading for acquiring knowledge. And you'd better ask people questions than just learning to them. At last, we talked about the types of changes which are 'simple', 'complicated' (e.g. space rocket), and complex (e.g. raise a baby). What a scientist! We met some girls from south Korea. They even know the pronunciation of Korea in Chinese.

This woman is full of passion and optimistic for life. She was born in India. For the future of all the children, her father decided to move to Canada which was a very open country at that time. Absolutely, Indian people are hard working and smart. Many of her family got the fellowship of universities (e.g. Cornell, Berkeley) in the US. She got two sons and two daughters. We talked about the life for old people. From our conversation, I can see that parents usually prefer to live with their children if possible. She told me her husband which is so kind and gentleman. He always scarifies himself for people. However, life seems to make a joke on him. This kind man suffer from dementia when he turned older. She comes to see him almost every day. What is love? The story besides you can give you the answer. Best regards to both of you.

Yesterday I talked with a lady. I did not write down her name (Jackie) because I could not find my pen. She is a mother of two sons. We talked about games (her son took the second place in the Warcraft III competition), food (she even cooks chinese food, e.g. ma po tofu), sports (she was basketball player at high school) and many other things. She went to China at 1983 for her honey moon. During the trip, she visited some factories and many cities. At that time, there were a lot of bicycles and only a few cars. While we talking, she corrected me some pronunciation mistakes and show me how to express myself in the right way. I said to her that everyone want to be younger. She denied that. She told me that young people have to worry about a lot of things, such as how to find a job, whom to love, how to buy a house. I think she really enjoys her life in her cottage. Life should be simple. Unfortunately, I am the one to keep others live simple.

Today I was picked by Shirley Taylor. She is a 84 years old lady who used to play piano as her career. One amazing thing is that her granddaughter is 35 years old now. She got 3 children and 5 grandchildren. And many of the grandchildren like skiing and her grandson even teaches ski lessons for young children. Then Nelson Freire joined us. She is a brazil girl who went to France for an internship. After that, she got a fellowship there and met her husband who was assgined to work in France by Canadian goverment. We talked about chinese history and some life things. For example, Nelson's child is fifteen months now, and they talk with three languages (French, Portuguese and English) in family. Well, it is very hard for the child to learn to speak now :)

LYNDA, a lawyer, a mother of two children and a female who loves sports a lot. While talking, you can see her love for the children. Last week, she told her son not to ski in the trees and not to follow his friends who always ski fast. However, bad thing happend. His son hit on a tree on the first trial and broke his leg. She said to me a mother usually has a prominent foresight. She also told me about her daughter who is a vegeterian. Her daughter is a the fourth year university student whose major is art (maybe not accurate). Though she got a driver license, she still has trouble to drive a car. Maybe artists do not drive car by themselves. Back to LYNDA, she is a happy woman and moves to a lot of places (even America) during her life. She grew up in Ottawa and selected the university which is away from home to be independent. She does a lot of sports like skiing, skating and riding bicycle. It must be very exciting to go to university by skating on the river. Moreover, she suggested me to join the winter lude to see the sculptures in Confederation Park. I enjoy talking to you and appreciate your sharing the time with me!

Today I talked to Danielle first. And then another person join us. So most of the time we practiced pronunciation. I think the key point is to speak the word entirely and do not ignore any part of the word. Next time I think I should have a schdule of which topics should be taken considerred and prepare some materials (e.g. pictures, personal information) for introducing myself.

Well, this is the second time for me to join the english conversation group. Today I met Joan, a kind lady who moved to Ottawa two years ago. She has two children, one daughter and one son. Her daughter works for children hospital with focusing on mental health. And Joan now has two grandchildren. The younger one is a girl who is almost one year. And the other one is a boy and he is almost two years and a half. I ask how the two children get along with each other. She said now everything is fine but before that the boy may hit his sister or grab something from her. Then we talk about her son in law, and she told me she likes him and thinks that he is a good person and can fix the house and many other stuff. This may be a little different from china, since we usually care more about money or degree. It is very pleasant for me to get the chance to know a person who may grow up in a very different. Thank you Joan for sharing your life story with me.

I heard about the group from my roomate. Since I was child, I begun to study English. At that time, practicing english speaking is very popular in my hometown Qingdao. Every week, people loving english went to English Corner which is located in qingdao landing stage (栈桥). Fortunately, I had been there by the adive of my father.

The place I went to today is some kind of the same with the English Corner. The first people I met is Haig. I think he is a local resident who was born in Vancouver. He went to British Columbia for education and now works for the Canada goverment. We talked about our hobby and he told me that he likes playing soccer. It is worth noting that he has been to China twice for the northern part and the southern part. What embarrasses me is he even visited more places in China than me. He could always find things that we can talk about which I really should learn from him. During our conversation, he mentioned two problems of my english speaking. One is the pronunciation such as computer "vision" and the other is to make right use of he or she. He also gives me a lot of encouragment and some tips to practice english e.g. listening to TED lecture and make chance to speak to more people. Overall, thank you Haig for your kindly communication!

最后一个舍友回国过圣诞后，我就有了那么一丝的孤独感，几天以后，渐渐的也适应了这种感觉。伴随着圣诞的临近，大街小巷的过节氛围也变得浓厚起来。散落在角落的圣诞树，耳边不时传来的问候，空荡荡的校园，对于我，这个生于热闹，长在热闹的人来讲，是一种莫名的煎熬。有多煎熬？在工作时间写这篇文章也许就是一个很好的印证。
