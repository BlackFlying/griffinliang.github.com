#### My experience in English Studying Group ####

Feb 7, 2017

LYNDA, a lawyer, a mother of two children and a female who loves sports a lot. While talking, you can see that her love for the children. Last week, she told her son not to ski in the trees and not to follow his friends who always ski fast. However, bad thing happend. His son broke his leg. She a happy woman and moves to a lot of places (even America) during her life. She grew up in Ottawa and selected the university which is away from home to be independent. She does a lot of sports like skiing, skating. It must be very exciting to attend university by skating on the river. Moreover, she suggested me to join the winter lude to see sculptures in Confederation Park. I enjoy talking to you and appreciate sharing the time with you!

Today I talked to Danielle first. And then another person join us. So most of the time we practiced pronunciation. I think the key point is to speak the word entirely and do not ignore any part of the word. Next time I think I should have a schdule of which topics should be taken considerred and prepare some materials (e.g. pictures, personal information) for introducing myself.

Well, this is the second time for me to join the english conversation group. Today I met Joan, a kind lady who moved to Ottawa two years ago. She has two children, one daughter and one son. Her daughter works for children hospital with focusing on mental health. And Joan now has two grandchildren. The younger one is a girl who is almost one year. And the other one is a boy and he is almost two years and a half. I ask how the two children get along with each other. She said now everything is fine but before that the boy may hit his sister or grab something from her. Then we talk about her son in law, and she told me she likes him and thinks that he is a good person and can fix the house and many other stuff. This may be a little different from china, since we usually care more about money or degree. It is very pleasant for me to get the chance to know a person who may grow up in a very different. Thank you Joan for sharing your life story with me.

I heard about the group from my roomate. Since I was child, I begun to study English. At that time, practicing english speaking is very popular in my hometown Qingdao. Every week, people loving english went to English Corner which is located in qingdao landing stage (栈桥). Fortunately, I had been there by the adive of my father.

The place I went to today is some kind of the same with the English Corner. The first people I met is Haig. I think he is a local resident who was born in Vancouver. He went to British Columbia for education and now works for the Canada goverment. We talked about our hobby and he told me that he likes playing soccer. It is worth noting that he has been to China twice for the northern part and the southern part. What embarrasses me is he even visited more places in China than me. He could always find things that we can talk about which I really should learn from him. During our conversation, he mentioned two problems of my english speaking. One is the pronunciation such as computer "vision" and the other is to make right use of he or she. He also gives me a lot of encouragment and some tips to practice english e.g. listening to TED lecture and make chance to speak to more people. Overall, thank you Haig for your kindly communication!

最后一个舍友回国过圣诞后，我就有了那么一丝的孤独感，几天以后，渐渐的也适应了这种感觉。伴随着圣诞的临近，大街小巷的过节氛围也变得浓厚起来。散落在角落的圣诞树，耳边不时传来的问候，空荡荡的校园，对于我，这个生于热闹，长在热闹的人来讲，是一种莫名的煎熬。有多煎熬？在工作时间写这篇文章也许就是一个很好的印证。
