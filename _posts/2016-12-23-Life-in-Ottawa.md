#### Before Chrismas ####

Dec 23, 2016

最后一个舍友回国过圣诞后，我就有了那么一丝的孤独感，几天以后，渐渐的也适应了这种感觉。伴随着圣诞的临近，大街小巷的过节氛围也变得浓厚起来。散落在角落的圣诞树，耳边不时传来的问候，空荡荡的校园，对于我，这个生于热闹，长在热闹的人来讲，是一种莫名的煎熬。有多煎熬？在工作时间写这篇文章也许就是一个很好的印证。 

#### My first experience in English Studying Group ####

Jan 18, 2017

I heard about the group from my roomate. Since I was child, I begun to study English. At that time, practicing english speaking is very popular in my hometown Qingdao. Every week, people loving english went to English Corner which is located in qingdao landing stage (栈桥). Fortunately, I had been there by the adive of my father.

The place I went to today is some kind of the same with the English Corner. The first people I met is Haig. I think he is a local resident who was born in Vancouver. He went to British Columbia for education and now works for the Canada goverment. We talked about our hobby and he told me that he likes playing soccer. It is worth noting that he has been to China twice for the northern part and the southern part. What embarrasses me is he even visited more places in China than me. He could always find things that we can talk about which I really should learn from him. During our conversation, he mentioned two problems of my english speaking. One is the pronunciation such as computer "vision" and the other is to make right use of he or she. He also gives me a lot of encouragment and some tips to practice english e.g. listening to TED lecture and make chance to speak to more people. Overall, thank you Haig for your kindly communication!
