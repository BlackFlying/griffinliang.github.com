Make "not" italic: Writing in Markdown is _not_ that hard!


Make the word "will" bold: I **will** complete these lessons!

Make the words "Of course" italic, and the words "a little moxie" bold: "_Of course_," she whispered. Then, she shouted: "All I need is **a little moxie**!"

Make the words "This is unbelievable" both bold and italic: If you're thinking to yourself, **_This is unbelievable_**, you'd probably be right.

**Blockquotes**

I read this interesting quote the other day:

>"Her eyes had called him and his soul had leaped at the call. To live, to err, to fall, to triumph, to recreate life out of life!"


This ensures that the entire blockquote is grouped together:

>Once upon a time and a very good time it was there was a moocow coming down along the road and this moocow that was coming down along the road met a nicens little boy named baby tuckoo...
>
>His father told him that story: his father looked at him through a glass: he had a hairy face.
>
He was baby tuckoo. The moocow came down the road where Betty Byrne lived: she sold lemon platt.
