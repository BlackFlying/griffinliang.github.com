### F1 score ###

F1 score is a harmonic mean of precision and recall. $$F_1=2\cdot\frac{precision \cdot recall}{precision+recall}$$

### Micro-F1 ###

Micro-averaged F1 for a binary or multiclass problem is identical to plain old accuracy. 


### Macro-F1 ###

Macro-averaged recall, also known as balanced accuracy, is popular and more useful than macro-averaged F1 for a binary problem.
